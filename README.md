# The Monster Controller

This is a number of programs, made in different languages, that have the same purpose: to control the monsters.

## Programming Languages

To keep the programs cross-platform, I've been able to use a differnt number of languages:

- C#
- Rust (console (found in 'Rust') and using Tauri (found in 'Tauri'))

C# is only UI (no console option)

## Currently working on: C#

I barely started on C# cross-platform...hush.
