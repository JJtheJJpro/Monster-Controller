# The Monster Controller

This is a number of programs, made in different languages, that have the same purpose: to control the monsters.

## Programming Languages

To keep the programs cross-platform, I've been able to use a differnt number of languages:

- C# (UI)
- Rust (console (found in 'Rust') and using Tauri (found in 'Tauri'))
- Python (console)

The Arduino code is found in the ArduinoSoftware folder.

## For Windows Only

I've made C# and C++ programs only suited for Windows platforms.

- C# (UI using WinForms)
- C++ (console and UI)
